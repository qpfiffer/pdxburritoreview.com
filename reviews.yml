      burrito "bite" things, which were good too, but they have a full kitchen now. It''s a really good,
      enormously dense burrito. Comes with a little side salad, too. Would recommend. 10/10.

    text: 'I''ve only eaten here once, and all I really remember about it is that
      I burned my tongue or the roof of my mouth or something. The burritos are smothered
      and come out RED HOT. Not a bad place, I just usually go to RoboTaco instead.

    text: 'One of the only burrito places I know of in Sweden. Pretty decent all-rounder.
      What''s extra good is you can get a menu which includes some chips, froyo and
      lemonade for like 30 SEK extra. Wide selection of fillings, tasted both the
      minced quorn and pulled oompf.
